== Description ==

Display a "Reusable blocks" listing page, and a link to view all posts containing a given block.

Only displays the number of posts that contain the block, not the number of times the block is used (does /not/ count multiple instances within a single post)

== Changelog ==

* Initial Release

== Props ==

This plugin was loosely based on https://wordpress.org/plugins/fabrica-reusable-block-instances/ -- some code was simplified and optimized for performance.
