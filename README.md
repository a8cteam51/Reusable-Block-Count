# Reusable Block Count

 Display a "Reusable blocks" listing page, and a link to view all posts containing a given block.

 Only displays the number of posts that contain the block, not the number of times the block is used (does /not/ count multiple instances within a single post)

# Props

 Loosely based on https://github.com/yeswework/fabrica-reusable-block-instances/ -- simplified the code for maintainability and readability.  Swapped to WordPress Core methods when available.
